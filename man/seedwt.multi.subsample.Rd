\details{
multiple maize inbreds were exposed to all combinations of the following stressors: drought, nitrogen, and density stress. Plants were grown in an experimental plot divided into eight sections, and each of the sections received a combination of between zero and three of the stresses previously mentioned, so that all possible stress combinations were included. More details about the experiment can be found in the references
